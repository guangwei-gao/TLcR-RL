You can run the Demo_TLcR_RL.m


Note that all the results in our paper were conducted in MATLAB R2014a.


We also provide the results of all comparison methods, including Wang et al.'s method [16], NE [14], LSR [4], SR [5], LcR [6], LINE [15], SRCNN [9], TLcR, and the proposed TLcR-RL, in the file of 'other results'.

Demo_other_methods.m is implementation of Wang et al.'s method [16], NE [14], LSR [4], SR [5], LcR [6], and LINE [15].
